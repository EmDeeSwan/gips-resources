# OVERLAY STRATEGY
A strategy in which the management of a certain aspect of an investment strategy is carried out separately from the underlying [[PORTFOLIO]]. Overlay strategies are typically designed either to limit or maintain a specified risk exposure that is present in the
underlying [[PORTFOLIO]] or to profit from a tactical view on the market by changing a [[PORTFOLIO]]â€™s specified risk exposure.
