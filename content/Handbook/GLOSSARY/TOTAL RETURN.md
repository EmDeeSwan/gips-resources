# TOTAL RETURN
## Calculation
The total return is the percentage change in value of real estate investments, including all capital return and income return components, expressed as a percentage of the capital employed over the measurement period. The total return numerator measures the change (increase or decrease) in investment value from both income (loss) and realized and unrealized gains and losses.

The formula for gross total return is as follows:

The formula for net total return is as follows:

The formulas for calculating gross component returns and gross total returns assume that no administrative fees were charged. If administrative fees are charged to the fund, the firm should adjust the numerator in the gross return formulas to add back any administrative fees.

All performance results, both total returns and component returns, must be clearly identified so that prospective investors can properly interpret and compare performance. In order to interpret performance data, prospective investors need to know what the performance results represent.
