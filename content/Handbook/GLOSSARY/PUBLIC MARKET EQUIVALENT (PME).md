# PUBLIC MARKET EQUIVALENT (PME)
The performance of a public market index expressed in terms of a [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN]] (MWR), using the same cash flows and timing as those of the [[COMPOSITE]] or [[POOLED FUND]] over the same period. A PME can be used as a benchmark by comparing the MWR of a [[COMPOSITE]] or [[POOLED FUND]] with the PME of a public market index.
