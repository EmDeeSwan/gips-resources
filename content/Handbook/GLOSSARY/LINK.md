The method by which sub-period returns are geometrically combined to calculate the period return, or by which periodic returns are geometrically combined to calculate longer-period returns, using the following formula:

Period return = ((1 + R<sub>1</sub>) × (1 + R<sub>2</sub>) … (1 + R<sub>n</sub>)) – 1

where R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> … R<sub>n</sub> are the sub-period or periodic returns for sub-periods or periods 1 through *n*, respectively.
