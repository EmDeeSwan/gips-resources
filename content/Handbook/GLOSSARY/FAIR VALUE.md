# FAIR VALUE
The amount at which an investment could be sold in an arm’s-length transaction between willing parties in an orderly transaction. The valuation MUST be determined using the objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, if available. In the absence of an objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market price for an identical investment in an active market on the measurement date, the valuation MUST represent the firm’s best estimate of the [[FAIR VALUE]]. [[FAIR VALUE]] must include any accrued income.
