# INCOME RETURN
## Calculation
The income return measures the investment income earned on all investments (including cash and cash equivalents) during the measurement period, net of all non-recoverable expenditures, interest expense on debt, and property taxes. The income return is computed as a percentage of the [[CAPITAL EMPLOYED]]. Capital employed is defined as the “weighted average equity” (weighted average capital) during the measurement period. Capital employed does not include any income return or capital return earned during the measurement period. Beginning capital is adjusted by weighting the external cash flows that occurred during the period.

The numerator in the gross income return represents the investment income for the pooled fund during the period, including any income earned during the period at the investment level, and also reflects all income, fees, and expenses at the property level.
