# SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW
The level at which the firm determines that one or more client-directed [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW|EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS]] may temporarily prevent the [[FIRM]] from implementing the [[COMPOSITE]] strategy. The cash flow may be defined by the [[FIRM]] as a single flow or an aggregate of a number of flows within a stated period. The measure of significance [[MUST]] be determined as either a specific monetary amount (e.g., â‚¬50,000,000) or a percentage of [[PORTFOLIO]] assets (based on the most recent valuation), and no other criteria, such as the effect of the cash flow or the number of [[PORTFOLIO|PORTFOLIOS]] in the [[COMPOSITE]], may be considered. Transfers of assets between asset classes within a [[PORTFOLIO]] or [[FIRM]]-initiated cash flows [[MUST NOT]] be considered significant cash flows.
