# CAPITAL EMPLOYED
The denominator of the [[COMPONENT RETURNS|COMPONENT RETURN]] calculation, defined as the “weighted-average equity” (weighted-average capital) during the measurement period. [[CAPITAL EMPLOYED]] does not include any [[INCOME RETURN]] or [[CAPITAL RETURN]] earned during the measurement period. Beginning capital is adjusted by weighting the [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW|EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS]] that occurred during the period.
