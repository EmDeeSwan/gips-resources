# CAPITAL RETURN
## Calculation
The capital return is the change in value of the [[REAL ESTATE]] investments and cash and/or cash equivalent assets held throughout the measurement period, adjusted for all capital expenditures (subtracted) and net proceeds from sales (added). The [[CAPITAL RETURN]] is computed as a percentage of the [[CAPITAL EMPLOYED]]. Also known as “capital appreciation return” or “appreciation return.”

The capital return numerator reflects the change (increase or decrease) in investment value adjusted for capital improvements, sales, refinancing, and net investment income activity. The numerator includes both realized gains/losses and the change in unrealized gains/losses from the prior period.

The net capital return reflects the deduction of any performance-based (incentive) fees attributable to the capital component for performance calculation purposes. This figure would exclude any performance-based fees attributable to the income component for performance calculation purposes.

The formula for gross capital return is as follows:
