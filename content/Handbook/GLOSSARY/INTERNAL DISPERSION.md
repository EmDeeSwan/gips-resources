# INTERNAL DISPERSION
## Definition
A measure of the spread of the annual returns of individual [[PORTFOLIO|PORTFOLIOS]] within a [[COMPOSITE]]. Measures may include, but are not limited to, high/low, range, and [[STANDARD DEVIATION]] (asset weighted or equal weighted) of [[PORTFOLIO]] returns.
### Calculation Methods
#### Equal-Weighted Standard Deviation
A widely used measure of internal dispersion is the standard deviation across equal-weighted annual portfolio returns. The formula is as follows:

where _R<sub>PORTi</sub>_ is the annual return on the ith portfolio that has been in the composite for the full annual period, _n_ is the number of portfolios in the composite for the full annual period (the use of _n_ is best practice and preferable, but either _n_ or _n_ – 1 in the denominator of the standard deviation calculation is acceptable), and _MEAN(R)_ is the equal-weighted mean return of the portfolios in the composite for the full annual period, where

where _R<sub>PORT1</sub>_ is the time-weighted return for the first portfolio in the composite for the full annual period, _R<sub>PORTi</sub>_ is the time-weighted return for the _i_ th portfolio in the composite for the full annual period, and n is the number of portfolios in the composite for the full annual period. Because only portfolios that are included in the composite for the full annual period are included in the internal dispersion calculation, n may be different from the number of portfolios at period end shown in the GIPS Composite Report.
#### Asset-Weighted Standard Deviation
Another widely used measure of internal dispersion is the asset-weighted standard deviation of annual portfolio returns. The formula is as follows:

where _W<sub>i</sub>_ is the individual portfolio weight and _R<sub>PORT1</sub>_ is the individual portfolio annual return
#### High-Low and Range
The high-low and the range are the simplest and most easily understood measures of internal dispersion. Their key advantages are simplicity, ease of calculation, and ease of interpretation. One disadvantage of these measures is that one extreme value or outlier can skew the internal dispersion measure.
#### Interquartile Range
Another measure of internal dispersion is the interquartile range, which measures the difference between the median value of ranked data sets _Q1_ and _Q3_
- Interquartile range: _Qr_ = _Q1_ – _Q3_
where
- _Q1_ = first or upper quartile return
- _Q3_ = third or lower quartile return

The following is an example of the calculation of the various internal dispersion measures.

Firm A has a composite that consists of 15 portfolios. Ten of the portfolios have been in the composite for the entire year.
