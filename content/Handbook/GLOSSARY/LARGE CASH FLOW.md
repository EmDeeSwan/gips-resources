# LARGE CASH FLOW
The level at which the [[FIRM]] determines that an [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW]] may distort the return if the [[PORTFOLIO]] is not valued and a sub-period return is not calculated. The [[FIRM]] [[MUST]] define the amount in terms of the value of cash/asset flow or in terms of a percentage of the [[PORTFOLIO]] assets or [[COMPOSITE]] assets. The [[FIRM]] [[MUST]] also determine if a [[LARGE CASH FLOW]] is a single [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW]] or an aggregate
of a number of [[EXTERNAL CASH FLOW|EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS]] within a stated period.
