## Standard for Firms
When calculating COMPOSITE [[MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURN|MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS]], the FIRM MUST calculate COMPOSITE returns by aggregating the PORTFOLIO-level information for those PORTFOLIOS included in the [[COMPOSITE]].
## Discussion
When calculating composite money-weighted returns, a firm is required to aggregate the portfolio-level information for all portfolios included in the composite. This method combines the assets and external cash flows from all portfolios in the composite, so the return is calculated as if the composite were one portfolio. The following example shows how since-inception internal rates of return (SI-IRRs) can be calculated for a composite that includes multiple portfolios.

In 2019, the composite includes only Fund 1. The composite SI-IRR will be based solely on the cash flows and terminal value of Fund 1. In 2020, Fund 2 joins the composite, and at the end of 2020, the two-year annualized SI-IRR will be based on the combined cash flows and terminal values of Funds 1 and 2. In 2021, Fund 3 joins the composite, and at the end of 2021, the three-year annualized SI-IRR will be based on the combined cash flows and terminal values of Funds 1, 2, and 3.
